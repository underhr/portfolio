        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Haley, and I am a 22 year old front end web developer. I took web development classes from 8th through 10th grade, and enjoyed them very much. My first year was my favorite, being my gateway into coding, and learning HTML and CSS. I was very excited to learn JavaScript, but unfortunately we didn't learn much of it. Instead, we used scratch, practiced advanced HTML and CSS, or copied and pasted W3Schools for any of our JavaScript needs. Over the last year, I have been on a mission to independently learn JavaScript, and dabbling in other programming languages, just trying to get the feel of everything. I've taken a few breaks as to not burn myself out, but overall I am quite dedicated to learning JavaScript, and making a career out of my favorite hobby.</p>
